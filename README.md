## Configuration
The config file for tracking is located in `~/.tracking/config.yml`.

The default settings are listed below, along with a description of each setting.
```ruby
# path to the data file (string, ~ can be used)
:data_file: ~/.tracking/data.csv
# number of lines to be displayed at once by default (integer)
:lines: 10
# width of the task name column, in characters (integer)
:task_width: 40
# format to use for elapsed time display (:colons or :letters)
:elapsed_format: :colons
# toggle colored display of the current (last) task
:color_current_task: true
# toggle header describing tracking's display columns (true or false)
:show_header: true
# toggle display of seconds in elapsed time (true of false)
:show_elapsed_seconds: false
```

## Elapsed Time Formats
Elapsed times are displayed in this order: days, hours, minutes, seconds (if
enabled)
- hide elapsed seconds
	- colons: `01:02:03` (default)
	- letters: `01d 02h 03m`
- show elapsed seconds
	- colons: `01:02:03:04`
	- letters: `01d 02h 03m 04s`

## Contributing to tracking
- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented
or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it
and/or contributed it.
- Fork the project.
- Start a feature/bugfix branch.
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
future version unintentionally.
- Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to
have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please
isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
